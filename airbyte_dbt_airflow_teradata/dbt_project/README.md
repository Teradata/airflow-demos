## This project

We've created two dbt models: example (which contains the default dbt example from jaffle-shop) and  ecommerce, which uses data from the dataset extracted via airbyte using the Faker source.

This project is being orchestrated via Apache Airflow. For more details in orchestrating dbt models with Airflow, you can check the `orchestration` folder in this quickstart.
